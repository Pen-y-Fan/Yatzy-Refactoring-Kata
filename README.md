# Yatzy Refactoring Kata

## Origin

This Refactoring Kata was designed by Jon Jagger and is available in his Cyber-Dojo. See
[his blog post](http://jonjagger.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/yahtzee-cyber-dojo-refactoring-in-java.html)

[@emilybache](https://github.com/emilybache/Yatzy-Refactoring-Kata) have changed it a little, so that the rules more 
closely match the original game.
